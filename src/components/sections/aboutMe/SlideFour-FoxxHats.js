          Prior to my monastic experience, I taught myself how to make beanies.
          The actual selling of these beanies was not taken seriously until
          after I left the Kellion. I worked with another individuals and we
          attempted to build this company. As it was my first attempt, I had
          little understanding of what I was doing. I learned a great deal
          through this endeavor and morphed the company away from my own
          identity of an association of a fox into something other.
