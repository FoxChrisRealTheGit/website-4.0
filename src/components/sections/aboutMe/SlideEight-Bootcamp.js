          While working on my graphic design degree, I tried to work at an
          Amazon Fulfilment center. I hurt my back pretty quickly while working
          there, and they sent me to a doctor that said it looked like I had a
          sliped disc but wouldn't look at it any further. The Amazon Amcare
          then told me to find a new job. Unwilling to accept this, I took a
          month personal leave but after two weeks of being in extreme pain, I
          agreed. I then began to look into coding bootcamps. I sold my car and
          went to Utah in hopes of better job prospects.
