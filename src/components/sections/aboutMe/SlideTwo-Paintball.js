          I've been playing paintball since the 8th grade. It is a sport that
          has truly captured my heart. Specifically, tournament speedball. The
          high risk plays that can be made are not nessesarily prevelant in
          other sports. Paintball has taught me a high degree of teamwork and
          problem solving in a high stress environment.
