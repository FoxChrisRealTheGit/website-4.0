          Since leaving the bootcamp, I have worked every day near 10-14
          hours a days on code and development. It has been extremely mentally
          taxing as extreme moments of isolation is difficult for our species. I
          recall  when I was studying buddhism prior to Hesychasm many years ago, that I envied a
          monk that spent six months in isolation in a forest. I don't believe I
          envy that monk any longer. Through the experience I have an unrivaled
          confidence in my ability to code and solve problems.
