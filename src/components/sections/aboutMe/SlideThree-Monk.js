        After some very interesting life experiences, I started to learn
        everything that I could about everything. This drove me into rather
        interesting topics and by chance, I met an Archbishop. After two years
        of self-study, my life directed me into a position where I moved in
        with the Archbishop to study Hesychasm. After a number of
        unexplainable occurrences, I felt the want to come back to the world.
