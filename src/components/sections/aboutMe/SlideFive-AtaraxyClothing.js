          This company grew out of the need to rebrand Foxxy Hats. Many people
          found the name to be a joke, and did not take Foxxy Hats seriously. So
          we attempted to rebrand the company to more easily incorporate other
          clothing items. After an intiial launch with shopify, I've rebuilt
          this website several times to use various web technologies. This
          project is presently non active.
